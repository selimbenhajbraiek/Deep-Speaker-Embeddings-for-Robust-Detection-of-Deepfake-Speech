# Deep Speaker Embeddings for Robust Detection of Deepfake Speech

## üåê Overview

DeepfakeShield is a machine learning project aimed at detecting deepfake (AI-generated) speech using pre-trained speaker embedding models and traditional classifiers. This is crucial for ensuring the reliability of forensic voice comparison systems and protecting against synthetic voice fraud.

## üìÅ Dataset

We used an **in-the-wild dataset** containing both bona fide (real) and spoofed (synthetic) speech samples. This ensured the evaluation covered realistic and diverse audio conditions, which are critical in forensic settings.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Methods

### üîä Speaker Embeddings:

* **X-Vector** \[5]
* **ECAPA-TDNN** \[3]
* **WavLM**

Embeddings were extracted using the **SpeechBrain** toolkit.

### üéì Classifiers:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

We tested the impact of scaling, fine-tuning, and model combinations.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation Metrics

* **Accuracy**
* **Precision**
* **Recall**
* **F1 Score**

These helped us compare models' ability to distinguish between spoofed and genuine speech.

## üìä Visualizations

### 5. t-SNE Embedding Visualizations

* **X-vector**: Best separation between spoof and bona fide classes
* **ECAPA-TDNN**: Moderate clustering with minor overlaps
* **WavLM**: High overlap, less effective in distinguishing classes

## üåê Dashboard

Built using **FastAPI**, **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Chart.js**. Features:

* Sections: Problem, Solution, Results, About Me
* Interactive charts
* Animated UI for professional presentation

## üöÄ Conclusion

* X-vector embeddings with SVM classifier delivered the best performance.
* t-SNE plots confirm strong class separation with X-vector and ECAPA-TDNN.
* Future work can include testing on multilingual datasets and improving WavLM through fine-tuning.
